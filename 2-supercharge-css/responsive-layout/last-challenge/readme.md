I wanted to do this last challenge on this repository, but I need to start my own personal project and apply what I've learned so far.

I will be doing these solutions on another repository: [parent-child interaction](https://github.com/a10n-jsd/parent-child-interaction).

Let's do it!

Wait, wait, take a look at the requirements for the
[Last Challenge](https://i.imgur.com/hAP2jgT.png) first.
