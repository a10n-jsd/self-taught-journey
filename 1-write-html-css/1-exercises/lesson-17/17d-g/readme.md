Instead recreating well-known websites, I prefer to build things from:
* [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

* [UI Design Daily](https://www.uidesigndaily.com/)

I will consider make a pull request for one of the rest exercises (17d, 17e, 17f, or 17g). 

Please wait, My Great Teacher, Simon Bao.
