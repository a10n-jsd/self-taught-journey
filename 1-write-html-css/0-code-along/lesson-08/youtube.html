    <!-- 
      Note to my self:
      I found that the two most common display values are block element and inline element instead of explained in the tutorial which are block and inline-block element (see: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp#gsc.tab=0)

      What's the major difference of inline-block compared to block elements and compared to inline elements? (see: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_inline-block.asp)
